# Sorting_Visualizer

A Web Application which lets one visualize how various sorting algorithms work. It allows users to
select the sort algorithm, select the array size, and speed of the visualization.

It showcases the inner workings of sorting algorithms.

Implemented Sorting Algorithms:
1) Bubble sort
2) Selection sort
3) Insertion sort
4) Merge sort
5) Quick sort
6) Heap sort

Features:
1) Colored representation of steps being executed:

    Blue:default
    Yellow: Being compared
    Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved
    Green: In correct position

2) Controls for visualising:

    Speed of visualization (5 speed levels)
    Data size ()
    Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data)

3) Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized.
